# Sentiment-Analysis-in-Text

In this NLP project, we have performed sentiment analysis on the [Sentiment140](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140) dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset consists of 1.6 million tweets that are classified into positive and negative sentiments. The goal of this project is to classify tweets into these two classes.
